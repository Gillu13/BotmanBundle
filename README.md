# Readme

Use this bundle if you want to integrate [BotMan](https://botman.io/) in your Symfony (>3.4) projects.

Currently it is very basic bundle but this is an ongoing work so stay tuned!

It is inspired by [Sergio Gomez BotMan symfony bundle](https://github.com/sgomez/botman-bundle) since it uses the idea of configuring Symfony's services container in the BotMan instance.
